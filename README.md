# OpenCV for beginners 

Welcome to the "OpenCV for Beginners" guide! This repository is designed to help you learn the fundamentals of computer vision using OpenCV. If you are new to the world of computer vision or want to refine your skills, you are in the right place.

## Introduction to Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with enabling computers to interpret and understand the visual world. The main goal is to develop systems that can emulate the human ability to perceive and understand the environment through image or video analysis.
This field deals with several activities, including:

- <b>Object recognition</b>, identify and classify objects present in an image or video;

- <b>Object tracking</b>, monitor the movement and position of objects over time;

- <b>Facial recognition</b>, identify and authenticate people based on facial characteristics;

- <b>Image segmentation</b>, divide an image into smaller regions or objects to analyze the different parts separately;

- <b>Motion Analysis</b>, understand and interpret the movements of objects or people in a video.

## Introduction to OpenCV

[OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/), an acronym for <i>Open Source Computer Vision Library</i>, is an open source library widely used in the field of computer vision. It provides a set of tools and functions for developing computer vision applications efficiently. it is written in C++ but also offers bindings for python, making it accessible to a large community of developers.
